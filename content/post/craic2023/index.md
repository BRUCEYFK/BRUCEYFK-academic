# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Our project implements a universal obstacle-avoidable motion planning scheme based on DRL for robot manipulators. The scheme focuses on simultaneous obstacle avoidance of both a robots's end-effector and its body, and the trajectory is generated in and inverse kinematics-free manner. Moreover, the scheme can respond to the environmental change and achieve prompt re-planning.
